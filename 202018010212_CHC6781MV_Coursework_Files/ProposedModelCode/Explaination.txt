These two files are the same proposed code

Run1 is showing all the results needed

Run2 is modified to store history of model training in a csv file for fair comparison

For Grad-CAM explaination, the value of the convolutional output is used for heat map generation

however, each time compile or initializing a model will change the name of the targeted layer in grad-cam
code, therefore, plz restart the kernel each time, or you can get the last layer through other codes.
Setting the layer name manually is what I did
